Hi! My name is Tony Timmers. I am 25 years old and currently work for a company called London Computer Systems. I am currently on the Sales Team, but will be switching to becoming a Quality Assurance Software Tester on September 1st for our flagship product, Rent Manager. I am looking forward to learning more about software development and to hopefully start a career in this field.
